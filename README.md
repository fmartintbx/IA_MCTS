This project implements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to simulate optimal gameplay. The goal of this implementation is to explore how MCTS can be used for decision-making in a simple, yet strategic, game. The project is designed to showcase how the MCTS algorithm can efficiently predict the best possible moves by simulating various game scenarios and selecting the most favorable outcome.
Key Features:

    Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Uses a probabilistic approach to search the most promising moves by simulating multiple games.

    Tic-Tac-Toe Game Logic: Includes the basic game rules and mechanics for a two-player (or AI vs. AI) match.

    Move Simulation: Runs multiple simulations to evaluate potential outcomes for each possible move and selects the one with the highest chance of success.
    This repository serves as a learning project to deepen understanding of both Tic-Tac-Toe game mechanics and the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. It can be extended to other board games or applications requiring intelligent decision-making based on simulations.
